# showyourself

16 color image viewer for the terminal that uses [content aware image resizing](https://github.com/esimov/caire).

## An image

## The same image as displayed with an early version of `showyourself`

## Why?

I wanted to develop an image viewer that could be usable from within [`o`](https://github.com/xyproto/o), a little editor I wrote that targets VT100 compatible terminal emulators.
