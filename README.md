# showyourself

Image viewer for the terminal that uses [content aware image resizing](https://github.com/esimov/caire).

* Currently, it can only show one image, a grumpy cat, in [16 colors](https://github.com/xyproto/palgen), using `*` or `█` as the "pixel".
* I'm planning to make it more flexible in the future.
* See `TODO.md` for plans.

## A grumpy cat in a VT100 terminal emulator in 16 colors

## Same as above, but with `█` instead of `*`

## Why?

I wanted to develop an image viewer that could be usable from within [`o`](https://github.com/xyproto/o), a little editor I wrote that targets VT100 compatible terminal emulators.
